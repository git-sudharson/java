"R2D1QHRRSGIQY2","Willy H","I like the book but I do not like the inexpensive binding. It has no heft and seems far too light for a 600 page volume. Would I buy it again? Yes. The price was right. For $22 I guess one should not expect a leather bound library quality piece.","Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 15 February 2022","Good looking book",3,"","3"
"R78G0LPBWE0MV","J. Gatsby","A terrible book, there is nothing deluxe about this hardcover. The book is very lightweight for 600 pages, understandably so as the materials used are very cheap and flimsy. The pages are thin enough to be nearly translucent, the words on one side of the page can be seen on the other and the pages often stick together and hardly at all lay flat, the ends tending to curve upwards.A very disappointing purchase that I quickly returned.","Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 17 September 2022","Cheap Binding and Thin Pages",1,"",0
"R5PSHBZ45D2PY","Iris Tapley","The stories in this book are a bit of a challenge because the language is from the early 1900's. The stories are great. Everyone must read ""The Ransom of the Red Chief"".  Of course, some of the stories are better than others but the book is a beauty to have in one's collection.","Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on 9 June 2021","Beautiful looking book",5,"","3"
